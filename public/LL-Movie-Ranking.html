<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers.</h3>
<p>"The Two Towers" is a rousing adventure, a skillful marriage of special effects and computer animation, 
and it contains sequences of breathtaking beauty.</p>

<h3>The Avengers</h3>
<p>"The Avengers," much awaited by Marvel comics fans, assembles all of the Avengers in one film: Iron Man,
Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, the Black Widow and Hawkeye. </p>

<h3>Your Name</h3>
<p>Writer/director Makoto Shinkai takes what could have been a very cheesy “Freaky Friday”-esque 
concept and imbues it with melancholy and honesty.</p>
